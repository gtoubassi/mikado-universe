# Mikado Universe

A JavaScript based simulation of a toy universe which is useful in understanding entropy, the Second Law of Thermodynamics, and in particular the possible relationship between gravity and entropy (gravity as a so-called "Entropic Force").  At the very least it is a simple system whose rules lead to attraction of particles as entropy increases, vs a traditional "gas particles in a box" system driven by kinetic energy which  leads to particles randomly spread through space as entropy increases.

For best results run in Chrome or with v8.
